# DCGAN-Pytorch
Use dcgan to generate pictures

# Environments

torch==1.2.0

torchvision==0.4.0

numpy==1.15.1

matplotlib==3.0.2

ipython==7.16.1

# Append

DCGAN is often used for 32 * 32 and 64 * 64 image generation,   
For large resolution image generation, StyleGAN„ÄÅPGGAN is still needed.    
Of course, you can also use DCGAN to generate 128 * 128 and 512 * 512 pictures,    
but the quality of the generated pictures is not very good.
